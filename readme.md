## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to develop a web application using Grails. We expect to have 3-5 domain classes in the application including test cases for your domain classes.
In this case I have developed a Web Store, I choose a this application because I have in mind to finish this application with more classes and controllers and uploaded to a web server so it can be online and it can be something useful.
To develop this project I have been using STS (SpringSource Tool Suite) for Mac OSX and the version of grails is 1.3.7.
